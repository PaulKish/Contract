##3.01 What is Meant by Open Source##

The discussion about Open Source may have little bearing on your life if you
are not a developer; it tends to be a bit technical, so I'll try to keep the language plain and the points relevant to our work together.

I am very committed to the ideals of the Open Source movement. By working with
me, you are already receiving, for no additional charge, the benefits of other
developers' open source efforts: software like Drupal and all of its
contributed modules, and so on. I believe strongly in giving back to the
community, and the way that most developers are able to do that is by
abstracting work that clients pay them to do so that the work is useful to
other people.

##3.02 What that Means for Your Project##

Alright, the previous section was a bit vague, but here's what it comes down
to. While you will own the source code for whatever I build for you, I reserve
the right to abstract it out and release it to the community. Don't worry:
I won't be giving out any data that is sensitive to your company/business
(passwords, payment information, company secrets, etc.). Rather, I'll be taking
the functionality of the thing I built for you and, if possible, making it more
broad so that it's not so specific to your business model or industry. 

If I am able to and choose to do this, you can count on three things. Firstly,
I will notify you that I am doing so; secondly, I will give you attribution in
some capacity for having financed the project in part; and thirdly, I will,
unless we arrange otherwise, do all abstracting and releasing on my own time.
Open source is something I believe in and I do not expect you to foot the bill
if that's not your thing.

Most likely, this will not affect you whatsoever. But if you have any questions
about open source, your project, or my intentions, feel free to ask.
