5. Content and Code Ownership
=============================

5.01 Who owns the code after the project?
-----------------------------------------

With regard to static assets (images and copy), you do. Regarding code and functionality, I do.

Your payment for the work I do is actually payment to license the code that
I write for use on the site specified at the time of our agreement (unless
I expressly grant the permission to reuse the code on other sites, or any
license I release the code under grant suitable permissions).

If you would like to make other arrangements, I am willing to negotiate.

5.02 Implications for Open Source Contribution
----------------------------------------------

I am very committed to the ideals of the Open Source movement. By working with
me, you are already receiving, for no additional charge, the benefits of other
developers' open source efforts: software like Drupal and all of its
contributed modules, and so on. I believe strongly in giving back to the
community, and the way that most developers are able to do that is by
abstracting work that clients pay them to do so that the work is useful to
other people.

Since I actually own the source code for whatever I build for you, I reserve
the right to abstract it out and release it to the community. Don't worry:
I won't be giving out any data that is sensitive to your company/business
(passwords, payment information, imagery specific to your business, company secrets, etc.). Rather, I'll be taking
the functionality of the thing I built for you and, if possible, making it more
broad so that it's not so specific to your business model or industry. 

If I am able to and choose to do this, you can count on three things. Firstly,
I will notify you that I am doing so; secondly, I will give you attribution in
some capacity for having financed the project in part; and thirdly, I will,
unless we arrange otherwise, do all abstracting and releasing on my own time.
Open source is something I believe in and I do not expect you to foot the bill
if that's not your thing.

Most likely, this will not affect you whatsoever. But if you have any questions
about open source, your project, or my intentions, feel free to ask.
