###1.01 About the Project Scope###

###1.02 My Thoughts on Scope###

I like to adhere to a more Agile definition of project scope. That is to say,
I do not fear changes to the scope. In fact, I expect that, as we start
building, your ideas may change; that's sort of how people work. And rather
than choosing to ignore the fact that this happens often in software development, I prefer to embrace the fact and be upfront about it. So you, the client, must understand that
changes to the scope can (and usually will) affect the timeline and budget of
the project. 

If you would like to change something in the scope of the project, just let me
know and I will (usually) gladly accommodate.
